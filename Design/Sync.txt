	It allows app to automatically checks for updates in the background, using battery and your data plan. 
	
	You can customise how often it does these checks by adjusting the Refresh Interval. If you don't framework to update regularly, you should set this value to zero to
	conserve both your battery and your data use.
	
	NOTE*: All sync request will execute in a different thread. 

SYNC DESCRIPTOR
	
CREATING SYNC REQUEST	
	To create a sync request, you must create an instance of Sync Request. Once you create an instance you have to provide it to Sync Handler.
	
	ISyncRequest syncRequest = new SyncRequest();
	syncRequest.setName(name_of_your_sync_request);
	syncRequest.addResource(key_of_your_resource, resource);
	
	SyncHandler syncHandler = new SyncHandler();
	syncHandler.handle(syncRequest);
