Consuming RESTful Web services that seemlessly support your data in a variety of representation media types and abtract away the low-level details of the client-server communication is not an easy task without a good toolkit. Connect RESTful Web Services Framework is a open source, it is a powerful and flexible toolkit that makes it easy to consume RESTful Services. 

### Representation State Transfer

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. (It is sometimes spelled "ReST".) It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol  and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used.

REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications. The idea is that, rather than using complex mechanisms such as CORBA, RPC or SOAP to connect between machines, simple HTTP is used to make calls between machines.

In many ways, the World Wide Web itself, based on HTTP, can be viewed as a REST-based architecture. RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make queries), and delete data. Thus, REST uses HTTP for all four CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.


Connect is a lightweight, comprehensive, open source RESTful web API framework for the Android - Java, iOS - Objective C and Windows - C\#. It supports major internet transport, data format, and service descriptor standards like HTTP and HTTPS, SMTP, XML, JSON, Atom, and WADL.
